# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis Project

A complete end-to-end Excel + Power Query project built for the **Codebasics Resume Challenge**.  
This case study focuses on analyzing booking data for **AtliQ Grands**, a luxury hotel chain, to identify business risks and uncover insights that improve performance.

Let me know if you want this saved as a file or want help building the folder structure (`assets`, `sql`, `data`, `reports`) too. Happy to help with that next.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to connecting with you!
And don't hesitate to give me suggestions for better improvment.
